# GBM Trainer — Full Source (fixed)

This is the **full** app with all levels (1–11), plus Netlify SPA routing fixes and PWA settings.

## Deploy (no coding)
1. Create or open your GitHub repo.
2. Upload the **contents** of the `gbm-trainer` folder (not the ZIP itself).
3. Netlify (connected to the repo) will auto-build and publish.

If you had the old version installed on iPhone, delete the icon and clear Safari website data for your Netlify domain, then reinstall Add to Home Screen after the new deploy.
